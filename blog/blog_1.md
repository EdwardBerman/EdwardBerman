# Reflecting on my first paper

## What went right!

**Advisor: Professor Jacqueline McCleary** 

As someone who came into this project without any publications, my advisor was extremely important throughout this project. One thing I really appreciated was her philosophy of **Give Credit, Share Blame**. That is, when I made a mistake, she would share the blame with me when facing collaborators. Conversely, when I did something good, she would go out of her way to give me credit. This gave me the freedom to experiment and make mistakes, which paid off dramatically.  

**The Vision:**

We never deviated from the original plan. The original plan had a lot of forethought, including a go-no-go point that marked a clear committment before things had too much time sunk into it. Go-no-go points are useful!

**The Team: COSMOS-Web & Northeastern Cosmology Group**

Beyond just my advisor, so many people have invested time into me and my project and I am grateful for that. From weekly telecoms and group meetings to 3-hour long code reviews and paper editing sessions, I'm still floored by how many people have taken an interest in my work.

**Adaptability**

Adding a JOSS paper from what was originally an AJ paper was a really smart choice and a step outside of a comfort zone that a lot of Astrophysicists focusing more on analysis than methods wouldn't make!

**Journaling, Notes, Book keeping**

Don't throwaway deprecated code! Keep a research journal. Do it. Just do it !!!

## What went wrong

I still haven't reached my goal, but I don't think I ever will. At least, PSFex has had a 25 year headstart, so I have a ways to go to be able to beat in both **Accuracy** and **Speed**.
